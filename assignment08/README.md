### Introduction: 
a brief information about the project. 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

This project will help bring those who enjoy listening to music to feel more ease and excited to go to concerts/events, so that they can easily access information and find more about the artists they're interetsed in, whether it be tours, meet & greets, or performances--without having to use more time to go on social media or do more searches elsewhere. Users should find this project website extremely informational, friendly, and be able to purchase tickets to events with ease. This project will hopefully serve to make the community of music listeners, happier and more excited to go and check out more events.

In this project, I will propose a novel ux design of the mobile app to enhance the aesthetic experieince in local communitiies. In various context of aesthetic experience, the community plays a important role to share and culture the aesthetic taste of individuals. To offer the accessible and satisfactory user experience of aesthetics of everyday objects would be beneficial to timely and critical especially when the mis-informatioin is widely spread without warninigs.

###  Wireframe and graphic design element variation 
The purpose of my low-fidelity prototypes is to check and test the functionality of my new designs. It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality. My low-fidelity prototype is used to test how the features I proposed flow within a userâ€™s online shopping experience, and focuses on its practicality rather than visual appearance.
