### Introduction: 
For this project, I will propose a new mobile app that will enhance the experiences of music listeners and event attendees. 
Sense of community plays an important role in better promoting events and bringing more individuals to appreciate live music. 

This project will help users feel more ease and excitement when planning to go to concerts and upcoming events. Users will be able to easily access information and find the latest updates with artists they like, whether it be tours, meet & greets, or pop up performances. Users should find this app extremely informational, friendly, and easy to use. This project will hopefully serve to make the community of music listeners more excited to experience live music events. 

Thus, I create three features that are important in shaping the social aspect of music apps. Users will be informed and updated without having to take the time to go on artists personal social media and do multiple searches elsewhere. The ability to communicate with others will encourage people to be a part of something bigger.  

### Design statement: 
Currently, there aren't any music apps that I know of that allow for social networking or making new friends the way friendly networking apps like Bumble and LinkedIn do. The purpose of this project is to make an app for music listeners to have more social interactions and be able to connect with those around them through something they enjoy. The issue is that many people love music but it's hard for them to make friends who have similar music taste. People may also not be as motivated to go to events because sometimes they don't have friends to go with and they're afraid or uncomfortable going alone. This app will bring those who have the same music taste to connect with others and make new friends!

Through the app, users will be able to feel comfortable voicing their opinions, have the opportunity to make new friends, while having an efficient and effortless way to find out what's new with the artists they follow or recommended artists. 

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation 
I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two music streaming mobile apps, named Audius and Audiomack. I chose to analyze these two because they had very different approaches and styles. By evaluating them with the 10 heuristics made by N/N Group, I saw what I needed to incorporate and don't incorporate on my app. 

Audius specifically inspired me to make this mobile app. Audius is a music streaming platform that aims to create a unity-based, decentralized community of artists, content creators and listeners. I'm trying to do something similar, where an app can bring a more united community between artists, their work, and their listeners, however, I wanted to especially wanted to focus on the features that would allow music listeners to chat with others and discuss the latest music/event releases together. 

One of the biggest issues of Audius for me was that the app was too simple and minimalist, which resulted in not being informative enough, leaving me to feel lost and not knowing what to do sometimes. So when I created this app, I made sure to highlight the essential information and create easy-to-understand-and-use functions for music listeners to be able to do what they need and want to do without confusion. Communication is a great way to clarify anything so with an app that will have many others to talk to will alleviate frustrations that users tend to have with only computer generated messages.

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing 
Usability testing is important because it is crucial for successful user-centered design. It helps designers see what real world users would struggle with when completing a task or trying to meet a goal. By getting feedback from users, designers can make changes that improve users experiences by making the app more effective, efficient, and satisfactory.

In my pilot UT, I observed what an active music lister appreciates from music mobile apps, what they find challenging, and what features or additions he would like to see to help elevate his experience.

### User research 
I conducted user research by examining how someone who often goes to music concerts and events finds her information on tickets and details of events itself. Through contextual inquiry, the participant was able to go through their usual process in finding information. I found out that it took a lot of time for users to do this because users have to trust a site before paying money and purchasing a ticket. There are also other things to take into consideration and that impact a user's decision to purchase through one website over another. I was able to learn from the user about what makes a website satisfactory and better to use. 

Although I felt as if I was getting enough information through UTs and my own experiences, and knowledge, I realized that there's always more I can learn from others, and people who are different from me. My participant gave me ideas that I wouldn't have thought of as a nuisance myself. It's important to consider what others struggle with and what others like. 

Certain limitations for finding tickets and information about certain events are that some users may not have the social media accounts. Users may spend too much time, looking through different websites to find more information that is trustworthy and reasonably priced. Therefore, added functionality and features incorporated in this project will address those needs, be welcoming, and flexible to all kinds of music listeners, so they can constantly and quickly use this website and be the go to.

### UX storytelling 
The purpose of UX Storytelling is so that we can understand how different users operate, what their motivations, needs, and wants are, so that UI/UX designers and researchers can create products and systems that cater to target users' expectations and experiences. UX Storytelling helps us understand our users on a more personal level so that we can predict responses from our target users more accurately. Personas help us picture what it's like to be in the shoes of our users. In order to create products that are beneficial to our users, we have to think of real life conflicts that users would want to solve. The more I brainstorm about different personas and what they would want from my app, the more I am able to make improvements on my designs to cater to a diverse group of users. From my findings so far, I was able to create personas that would help me empathize and understand targeted users on a more accurate level.

###  Wireframe and graphic design element variation 
In my new mobile app, Plura, I created three features to make the site more informative and fun to use: 

1. Forum & Chat box: allows you to create topics, comment on each other's posts, like comments, repost, or share opinions related to music

2. Connect: suggests other users as potential friends, will show you mutual friends, mutual taste in music, etc

3. Latest: notifies you on the latest events from artists you like, whether it is their tours, shows, meet & greet, released albums, or songs

The purpose of creating wireframes is to see whether my designs are clear and ready to transition to the real thing. It allows me to see the bigger picture. This step is when you find out whether the cool ideas I had in my head worked well together, whether it's the different icons I picture to represent my app, different placements of these functions, the design of overall app. I can transform my thoughts onto paper or a screen so people can interact with the app and picture the way they would navigate through the app. Through this step, I can focus on the accessibility of the features, and not the visual, aesthetic appearance.

### Low-fidelity prototype  
Next, I drew sketches to show how users would navigate through the app. These low-fidelity prototypes helped me imagine the flow of things, whether users would have an effortless experience when exploring, searching, and communicating through the app. With the three user personas and scenarios I created, I had three tasks to focus on:

### High-fidelity prototype 
To bring my vision to life, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This allowed me to explore my creative boundaries and move forward with what just started as an inspiration. This more concrete and detailed prototype not only gives me a better picture of how everything looks together but provides testers a look into the music world. Whether users are able to flow through the screens or get stuck at some point, all of this was valuable information for me to iterate towards a better user experience.

I used Figma to create an interactive high-fidelity prototype of my mobile app, Plura. This enabled me to see whether it is a smooth process for users to navigate through the app. Since it includes colors, UI components, and more visualizations, I was able to more accurately see what worked for others and what doesn't. I know how I view something wouldn't be the same as another pair of eyes, so sharing my vision and getting feedback on it made it a lot more clear to me as to how people viewed my design features and what I needed to work on.

### Reflection
Before I heard of this class, I had little to no clue as to what UI/UX was. After this class, I can say that I've learned more than I could've imagined to learn in the past ten weeks. I never would've saw myself as someone who would work in tech, because I thought it wasn't for me. But this class changed my mind and taught me about the creative side of technology. As a graduating sociology major, I didn't have a clear goal or direction of what I wanted to do, but now that I have found such an awesome career field who values human behavior majors, I feel a determination to work towards this field. This project inspired me, challenged me, and pushed me to believe in my visions and bring them to something tangible that I can share with others and connect with others. Especially in times like this, I believe that people can benefit from making new friends. I am a firm believer that music soothes the soul, so it was really exciting to learn how to make an app that I'm proud of and would like to share with the world. There's many music platforms, but I have yet to find one that involves social networking. Through this project, I learned that there are steps to bringing your thoughts to life, and it's not easy. I was able to exercise my social skills, my creative side, and my patience, and determination. I will always remember that the process to making something sucessful includes understanding people, exploring your options, and materializing everything together. I learned that it's not enough to make something look good, but for it to create great experiences.
