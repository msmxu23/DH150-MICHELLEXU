### Introduction: 
For this project, I will propose a new mobile app named PLURA, which stands for Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect All. 

For those who attend music festivals, which mostly revolve around electronic dance music (EDM), you may be familiar with the acronym: PLUR--which is the mantra that inspired the name of this app. However, this app is not only intended to target those who enjoy EDM, which is why I added "All" at the end. This app will strive to connect all different kinds of artists, DJs, and bands with their fans and followers on a more personal level.

Dating and social networking apps have become more and more popular, but none specifically cater to music. 

Plura is designed so that people who enjoy listening to music can make friends with similar music taste, share their thoughts on new releases or events, and easily access information on live music. On the bonus side, users will be updated directly  with updates from artists they follow. 

Thus, I created three features that will emphasize this vision. By combining attributes from communication apps, ticket selling platforms, and social media apps like Twitter, users can experience it all on PLURA. Users will feel informed and involved in the music community without having to search or visit multiple sites. The capabilities for users to connect, communicate, and network will bring music listerners together to be a part of something bigger. 

### Design statement: 
Currently, there are no social networking apps that focus on the music world. The reason why I created PLURA is so that people can communicate through music and make meaningful connections. Many people enjoy music but don't have a specific place to go to connect with others over music. This app will bring those who have similar music taste to connect with each other and feel more involved in a community. Through the app, users will be able to feel comfortable voicing their opinions, have the opportunity to express themselves through music, while efficiently and effortlessly find out what's new. 

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation 
I conducted a heuristic evaluation on two music streaming mobile apps called Audius and Audiomack. I chose to analyze these two because they had very different interface styles and approaches to promoting artists and music. By evaluating them with N/N Group's 10 heuristics, I realized what I should incorporate or shouldn't incorporate on my project. 

Audius is a streaming platform that aims to create a unity-based, decentralized community of artists, content creators and listeners. With PLURA, I am aiming to do something similar, where it can bring a more united community between artists, their work, and their listeners, however, I wanted to especially focus on creating the social features of my app. 

But one of the biggest issues of Audius for me was that the app was too simple and minimalist, which left me feeling lost or not knowing what to do at times. So when I created PLURA, I made sure to include essential information and incorporate easy-to-understand functions for music listeners to do what they want to do without confusion. That is also why I wanted to create this app so that people can express themselves and talk to others to bring better communication and create a stronger community.

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing

Usability testing is important because it is crucial for successful user-centered design. It helps designers see what real world users would struggle with when completing a task or trying to meet a goal. By getting feedback from users, designers can make changes that improve user experiences in making the app more effective, efficient, and satisfactory.

In my pilot UT, I observed what an active music lister appreciates while using mobile apps surrounding music, and found out what he finds challenging, and what features or additions he would like to see to help elevate his experience.

### User research 
To include the feature of being able to learn about live events and purchase tickets, I conducted user research by examining someone who often goes to music concerts and events. I was able to observe how she usually finds her information on tickets and details of the events. Through contextual inquiry, the participant was able to go through their normal process in finding information and tickets. I was able to learn what contributes to her choice of site when purchasing tickets. I realized that it took a lot of time for users to do this because users have to feel a sense of trust before paying money. I was able to see what made one website better than another and took notes of those attributes. 

Although I felt as if I was getting enough information through UTs and my own experiences, I realized that there are always more I can learn from others and people who are different from me. My participant showed me difficulties that I wouldn't have thought of as a nuisance myself, and I realized it's important to consider what others struggle with and what others like. 

Certain limitations for finding tickets and information about events are that some users may not have social media accounts. Users may also spend too much time, looking through different websites to find more information that is trustworthy and reasonably priced. Therefore, added functionality and features in PLURA will address these needs, be helpful, and flexible to all kinds of music listeners, so that they would constantly want to use this app.

### UX storytelling 
The purpose of UX Storytelling is so that we can understand how different users operate, what their motivations, needs, and wants are, so that UI/UX designers and researchers can create products and systems that cater to target users' expectations and experiences. 

UX Storytelling helps designers understand users on a more personal level so that they can predict responses from target users more accurately. Creating personas have helped me picture what it's like to be in the shoes of the users. In order to create products that are beneficial to my user, I had to think of real life conflicts that users would have and want to overcome. The more I brainstorm about different personas and predict what users would want to experience on PLURA, I am able to make improvements on my design to cater to a diverse group of users. From my findings so far, my personas allowed me to empathize and understand users on a more accurate level.

###  Wireframe and graphic design element variation 
In my new mobile app, Plura, I created three features to make the site more informative and fun to use: 

1. Forum & Chat box: allows you to create posts, comment, like, repost, or share opinions related to music, and private message friends 

2. Connect: suggests users with mutual friends and mutual taste in music to become frends with 

3. The Latest: notifies you on the latest news and events from artists you like, whether it is their tours, shows, meet & greet, released albums, songs, or posts 

The purpose of creating wireframes is to see whether my designs are clear and ready to transition to the real thing. It allows me to see the bigger picture, instead of the individual features. Wireframes put together the cool ideas I had in my head into a group, which allows me to see if they can work well together and make sense, such as the different icons used for my app, the different placements of these functions, and overall design of the app. This way, I can transform my thoughts onto paper or a screen so that other people can see my vision and picture the way users would navigate through the app. And importantly, I can focus on the accessibility of the features, which contribute to the overall experience, and not just the visual, aesthetic appearance.

### Low-fidelity prototype  
Next, I created wireflows to show how users would navigate through the app. These low-fidelity prototypes shows the flow of the design, and help me see whether users would have an effortless experience when exploring, searching, and communicating.  With the personas and scenarios, I illustrated three different wireflows to show how each feature would work.

### High-fidelity prototype 
To bring my vision to life, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This allowed me to explore my creative boundaries and move forward with what just started as an inspiration. This more concrete and detailed prototype not only gives me a clearer picture of how everything would come together but provides testers a chance to interact with something closer to the real thing. This interactive prototype will truly show whether users would be able to flow through the screens effortlessly or get stuck. Any feedback at this point is valuable information for me to iterate towards a better user experience.

Figma enabled me to see whether users would have a satisfactory experience when navigating through the app. Since it includes colors, UI components, and more visualizations, I was able to see more accurately what works for others and what doesn't. How I view one thing wouldn't be the same as another pair of eyes, so sharing my vision and getting feedback on it was very helpful on finding out what I needed to work on.

### Reflection
Before I heard of this class, I had little to no clue as to what UI/UX was. After this class, I can say that I've learned more than I could've imagined to learn in the past ten weeks. I never would've saw myself as someone who would work in tech, because I thought it wasn't for me. But this class changed my mind and taught me about the creative side of technology. As a graduating sociology major, I didn't have a clear goal or direction of what I wanted to do, but now that I have found such an awesome career field who values human behavior majors, I feel a determination to work towards this field. This project inspired me, challenged me, and pushed me to believe in my visions and bring them to something tangible that I can share with others and connect with others. Especially in times like this, I believe that people can benefit from making new friends. I am a firm believer that music soothes the soul, so it was really exciting to learn how to make an app that I'm proud of and would like to share with the world. There's many music platforms, but I have yet to find one that involves social networking. Through this project, I learned that there are steps to bringing your thoughts to life, and it's not easy. I was able to exercise my social skills, my creative side, and my patience, and determination. I will always remember that the process to making something sucessful includes understanding people, exploring your options, and materializing everything together. I learned that it's not enough to make something look good, but for it to create great experiences.
